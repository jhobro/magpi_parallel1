This example shows how the `make` utility can be used to distribute work
over multiple cores for certain tasks.

Starting with a set of existing images, we are going to make a collage
of thumbnails for all the images.  This is a task that might be
repeated as the set of source images changes or is updated.  We want
to use all four cores of a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 if possible.  Each
thumbnail can be generated independently, so up to four can be
generated at any one time.  Once all the thumbnails are ready, the
collage is made from them.

The `make` utility will automatically distribute the work required over
the four available cores.  Place your original images inside the
`fullsize` directory (any image file format recognised by ImageMagick
can be used) and then type

    make -j4

which starts make and tells it to run up to four jobs simultaneously.
If there are sufficient images then it will run in approximately a quarter
of the time compared with using a single core.  To remove the thumbnails
and collage (clean up) use

    make clean

The rules that make this possible are given inside the Makefile.
